        <p>Here's some useless Copyright jargen that no one really reads. I imagine its really important but honestly who reads footers unless you're trying to find more contact info to complain about something? I think the last time i looked down here, i was trying to find out if a company was hiring and didnt know where to find the link i suppose. Maybe it does have it uses after all. I didnt get the job if you were wondering. Their loss right? I hope so.</p>
